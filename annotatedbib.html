	<h2><i> Corballis, M. C. (2010). Mirror neurons and the evolution of language. Brain and Language,112(1), 25-35. doi:10.1016/j.bandl.2009.02.002 </i></h2>

<div class="a"> In “Mirror neurons and the evolution of language”, Corballis reviews other studies in order to discuss how the mirror neuron system aided in the development of human language. Simply put, he argues that mirror neurons allowed for a “conventionalized” communication system. This system allowed for symbolic attribution to gestures, which gave rise to complex cognitive abilities. The increase in cognitive capabilities, grammatization, the use of vocalization and facial expressions then developed to form contemporary speech. </div>
  <div class="a">Corballis argues that mirror neurons provide a natural starting point for the evolution of language. Past studies propose that the purpose of mirror neurons is not to imitate actions but rather to understand the action. In other words, mirror neurons allow monkeys, and by extension humans, to understand action sequences by mapping them out into sections that can be done without actually mimicking the action. </div>
  <div class="a">In connection to language, Corballis reports that mirror neurons were first discovered in the frontal cortex of monkeys, the homologue of Broca’s area in humans. Corballis also reports that the parts of the brain implicated in mirror neuron mimicking is also critical for language. This finding lends itself to the idea that mirror neurons, are critical for language. Furthermore, the left hemisphere is implicated in language. Coincidentally, the mirror neuron system in humans is also lateralized to the left hemisphere. Putting this evidence together, Corballis argues that the mirror system in humans has properties that are not evident in other non-primate species. </div>
  <div class="a"> Corballis argues that the neural circuits in the human mirror system allows for communicative learning. That is, primates are distinguished from non-primates because they can attribute meaning to bodily gestures. Thus, this proliferated the use of gestures as an effective communicative system. Subsequently, a ‘mimic culture’ evolved when Homo sapiens became bipedal. This evolved to be a comprehensive hand signed language among early primates. This allowed for learned associations and more complex cognitive abilities. </div>
  <div class="a">
  Once the sign language is conventionalized, language was able to be expressed in a vocal and auditory modality. This is the weakest part of the argument -- aside from the connection that gestures often accompany speech, there is no evidence to support the jump from gestures to vocalization. To defend his theory, Corballis argues that the switch from gestures to spoken language was a natural, especially given that the mirror system also responds to acoustic stimuli. Again, coupled with the mirror system, vocalization lead to expression of facial movements. The neurons that are responsible for these facial expression serve as precursors for social communication. I chose to include this paper as part of my final project because it has a biological basis to backup the argument. So far, my research on the evolution of language in humans has only considered speculative theories. </div>

	<h2><i>Kirby, S. (2007) The evolution of language. In Dunbar, R. and Barret, L., editors, Oxford handbook of evolutionary psychology, pages 669-681. Oxford University Press. Printed in Great Britain. </i></h2>
		<p><div class="a"> In “The Evolution of Language” chapter by Simon Kirby, Kirby describes 3 theories that 
aim to explain the evolution of language. Kirby specifically discusses the comparative
approach, protolanguage theory, and the complex adaptive system. Kirby acknowledges that
these three theories are not the only theories that exist, but he suggests these are the ones that answer questions concerning its structure, uniqueness, function and history. </div>
<div class="a"> Kirby notes that communication and language are not the same. Most species have a communicative system, but that does not necessarily mean they have language. Thus, humans are unique because there exists language. The comparative approach takes a comparative perspective on language. Kirby first discusses the descension of the larynx. Humans are different in that our larynx are lower than in other species. Kirby discusses Lieberman's suggestion that the practicality of a descended larynx comes as a result of adaptation to communication. That is, its descension changed our vocal tract so that we are able to produce a wide variety of sounds. However, research has found that other species have a lower larynx possibly adapted as a survival trait. Having a lowered larynx allows animals to appear bigger and is used to compete against other males for female partners. </div>
<div class="a"> The proto-language theory aims to explain that humans had a prototype language system prior to the development of our current language. This is further divided into Bickerton’s prototype language and holistic protolanguage. Bickerton’s prototype language theory explains that early language systems could have had a pidgin component, a child language and language of trained apes component. These components all suggest that there is a reduced semantic structure that is seen in contemporary language. Thus, the question remains; could early humans have developed a prototype language prior to the system we have now? This question is answered by a transition phase, in which Bickerton argues that genetic change led to novel language faculties that allowed language to become more complex. </div>
<div class="a">  Lastly, the complex adaptive system view uses computational and mathematical models to study the interaction of agents, populations of individuals. This program is still not fully developed, but it has provided an interesting perspective on the structure and function of language. One perspective is that language evolved as an adaptation. It also suggests that language acquisition is a complex system. That is, only certain scenarios and interactions provide linguistic experience. The last perspective discussed is the Baldwin Effect. The Baldwin effect suggests that language has an influence on evolution -- especially going from a simple language to a more semantically complex one. </div>
<div class="a"> I chose to include this paper in my project because I wanted to add more biologically oriented theories to my discussion on the origins of language. Additionally, this paper is easy to read and can be easily explained to lay-people (which is the audience of my project). </div> </p>

	<h2><i>Schoenemann, P. Thomas, 2009, Brain evolution relevant to language. In Minett, James W. & Wang, William S-Y., eds., Language, evolution, and the brain, pages 191-223. Hong Kong: City University of Hong Kong Press. Published in Hong Kong. </i></h2>
	 <p><div class="a"> This chapter of Language, Evolution and the Brain focuses on brain changes, more specifically on encephalization and its impact on the development of language. While many linguists want to search for the pivotal point in time in which language emerged, Schoenemann’s goal was to argue that language and the brain evolved in parallel, therefore meaning that a larger brain allowed for the development of language and language evolved because of larger brains. To argue for his idea, Schoenemann cites various authors who have previously argued that humans are uniquely intelligent because of our  brain size to body size ratio. <br> </div>
	<div class="a">Schoenemann begins his argument by providing a general summary of the brain regions related to language. Historically, scientists argue that language is primarily localized in the left hemisphere. However, Schoenemann provides evidence that some language skills utilize the right, as well as the left, hemisphere. Specifically, he argues that prosody, the recognition of patterns in rhythm and sound, occurs in the right hemisphere. Schoenemann also discusses the prefrontal cortex, claiming that the prefrontal cortex is used for organizing semantic information and assessing grammatical information. Similarly, the cortex is also implicated in language. For example, Broca’s and Wernicke’s area are said to aid in language production and comprehension. Schoenemann includes a discussion on the brain stem and related areas that control for vocalization. <br></div>
	<div class="a">After discussing the main areas of the brain that are used in language, Schoenemann begins discussing the reciprocal relationship between brain size and language development. One of the biggest pieces of evidence for this relationship, according to the author, is sizable changes in brain size. For example, Schoenemann cites Dunbar’s Social Brain hypothesis, connecting to the idea that a larger brain meant longer life spans and more opportunities for transfer learning. Schoenemann also discusses social group size and brain size. Language is inherently a social activity, thus a larger group size would increase the likelihood of the development and usage of a language system. In addition, Schoeneman reports that the emergence of the neocortex, whose appearance in evolutionary lineages is relatively recent, is responsible for cognitive abilities. This allowed for language to naturally occur. This point is further supported by the fact that a bigger neocortex correlates with more complex processing. Lastly, Schoenemann connects brain size to neural density, claiming that axon density makes connection easier and more efficient. This is especially useful for the growing neocortex; as the size of the neocortex grows, connections between structures have to become more efficient. <br></div>
	<div class="a">SSchoenemann’s take home message is that the brain and language co-evolved. Structural changes had to occur for language to develop and, conversely, language drove those structural strategies.  I chose to include this paper because it specifically discusses how the human brain changed in accordance with language. </p></div>
