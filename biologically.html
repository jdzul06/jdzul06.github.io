<h1> Biologically Based Theories of Language Acquisition </h1> </header>

 <h2>Mirror Neurons </h2>
  <p>One hypothesis is routed in biological and anthropological evidence. Corballis argues that mirror neurons are the natural starting point for the development of language.

  <div class="a">
  In <a href="references.html"> “Mirror neurons and the evolution of language”</a>, Corballis discusses how the mirror neuron system aided in the development of human language. Simply put, he argues that mirror neurons allowed for the development of gestures, which then evolved to become an effective “conventionalized”  communication system. This conventionalization allowed for symbolic attribution to gestures, which gave rise to complex cognitive abilities. The increase in cognitive capabilities, grammatization, the use of vocalization and facial expressions then developed to form contemporary speech.
  <div class="a">
  Corballis argues that mirror neurons provide a natural starting point for the evolution of language. Past studies propose that the purpose of mirror neurons is not to imitate actions but rather to understand the action. In other words, mirror neurons allow monkeys, and by extension humans, to understand action sequences by mapping them out into sections that can be done without actually mimicking the action. Mirror neurons were first discovered in primate's frontal cortex, the homolougue of a human's Broca's Area. 
  <div class="a">
  Mirror neurons allowed for humans to create and copy gestures. As time went by, humans attributed menaing to these gestures, and a 'signed language' emerged. This then allowed for facial expressions, grammar and vocalization to co-evolve.

<h2>Comparative Anatomy Theories</h2>
<p>In "the Evolution of Language" Kirby describes three theories that aim to explain language acquisition from a biological and comparative perspective.

<ul><li><strong> Descension of the Larynx: </strong> Kirby discusses Lieberman's suggestion that the practically of a descended larynx comes as a result of adaptation to communication. As shown above, most non-human species have a higher larynx than humans do, suggesting that a descended larynx aided in the development of language. That is, its descension changed our vocal tract so that we are able to produce a wide variety of sounds. This then facilitated the development of langugae. 
  <li><strong> Proto-language Theory:</strong> this theory aims to explain that humans had a prototype language system prior to the development of our current language. This theory bluids upon the idea that the human/early-human had to experience a genetic change that lead to the development of a proto-type language.
    <li><strong>Complex Adaptive System View:</strong> This theory suggests that language acquisition is a complex system. That is, only certain scenarios and interactions provide linguistic experience. For example, this theory would support Chompsky's LAD theory; claiming that humans evolved a langauge system becuase it was an adaptive trait.</li> </li> </li> </ul> </p> </p> </a> </div> </div> </div>
