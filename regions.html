	<h1> Brain Regions Associated with Language </h1> 
	<p><i> <font color="#06A9AB"> “Language is not a singular, unitary cognitive ability, processed in a single place in the brain, but instead depends on the successful integration of a number of separate abilities” <br>
	 -Schoeneman (pg. 110) </i> </header> </font> 
		
	</p>
		<p> There are various parts of the brain that are implicated in language. These areas can be subdivided by major stuctures. The following information is taken from <a href="references.html">Schoenemann's </a> paper. 
      <br>

<div>
	<h2> Language in the Hemispheres </h2>
		<p> Various studies claim that language is lateralized in the left hemisphere. However,  <a href="references.html"> Schoenemann </a> makes an argument that some language processing occurs in the right hemisphere. According to Schoenemann, the right hemisphere is use for prosody. That is, the right hemisphere is used to analyze the patterns of stress, rhythm and intonation in language. </p>

<div>
	<h2> Language in the Cortex </h2>
		<ul> <li> <strong> Lateral Prefrontal Cortex:</strong> The pre-frontal cortex is implicated in language because it helps with organizing semantic information, assessing grammatical information and semantic information. It is also implicated in complex word analysis. 
      <li><strong> Lateral and Ventral Temporal Cortex: </strong>  The temporal corticies are implicated in integrating visual and auditory language related stimuli.
      <li><strong> Primary Auditory Perception: </strong> A big part of language is being able to hear it. The auditory pathway (including the medial LG) plays a huge role in transduction of sound into neural signals.
      <li><strong> Premotor Cortex: </strong> Studies have shown that the premotor cortex is crucially involved in speech perception <a href="references.html"> (Meister)</a>.
			<li><strong> Anuglar Gyrus: </strong> The angular gyrus aids in the phonological and semantic aspects of language</li>
      <li><strong>Broca’s Area:</strong> Broca’s Area is believed to be aid with speech production. Those classified with Broca’s Aphasia are non-fluent speakers, have awful grammar but have good comprehension
      <li><strong>Wernicke’s Area:</strong> Conversely to Broca’s Area, Wernicke’s Area is implicated in speech and written word comprehension. Thus, Wernicke aphasiacs have good grammar, are fluent but do not comprehend speech well.

	<h2> Language in the Cerebellum </h2>
		<p>The cerebellum was originally thought to be used for monitoring of motor movement but recent research has suggested that it’s also used in high cognitive capacities like language processing. More specifically, it can has been implicated in the production of sounds</p>

	<h1>How did the Brain Change to allow for Language?</h1> </header>
  <div class="a">
	<p> According to Schoeneman, the brain and language co evolved. That is, the brain grew in size to accommodate the demand language has on the brain, and language influenced the brain to grow in size. </p></div>
	<h2> Evidence:</h2> 
	<strong> Longer life span and transfer learning</strong> 
		<p>Like Dunbar and Leland argued, longer life spans meant more opportunities to learn thus more opportunities to create a complex language. Schoeneman quotes Beran et al 1999, claiming that “it turns out that brain size is the best neuroanatomical predictor of whether an animal excels at transfer learning: the larger the brain, the better they are at it (Beran et al. 1999)”. </p>
		<br>
	<strong>Social Group Size and Brain Size</strong>
		<p>Language is inherently a social activity. Thus, like Dunbar argued, the bigger the  social group size, the more complex things are and the brain can adapt to that. Similarly, Dunbar also argues that having a large group size brings about safety. A safe environment means that there is more opportunity to learn and spend time using language. </p>
		<br>
	<strong>Neocortex Size</strong>
		<p>Schoenemann notes that the neocortex is relatively new in the human lineage. However past studies have implicated it in higher cognitive abilities, like language. Other species do have neocortices, thus, this helps humans be unique. This uniqueness helped us develop a more complex language system. Moreover, Schoeneman argues that a larger neocortex means more processing, thus more ability for the brain to adapt to the emergence of something as complex as language. </p>
		<br>
	<strong>Neuronal Destiny and Connections</strong>
		<p>Lastly, Schoenemann argues that the fact that the human brain is bigger in size means that there are more neurons. These neurons lend themselves to more connections, thus the cognitive capacity to withstand the development of language. </p>
